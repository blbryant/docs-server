When the checkbox _Share usage information with Couchbase and get software update notifications_ is selected, Couchbase Server automatically collects configuration, usage, and performance data including the following:

* Cluster information such as settings and configuration, software version, cluster ID, load levels, and resource quotas.
* Browser information such as IP address, inferred geolocation at the city level, and browser type.

This collective information will also be referred to as "Performance Data".

The Performance Data is used by Couchbase to understand aggregate usage patterns and make our products more useful to you, as well as inform our sales and marketing programs. We do not access or collect any data stored in the Couchbase products.    

You may turn this feature off at any time by deselecting the checkbox.
